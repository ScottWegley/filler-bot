# Game Pigeon Filler Bot

## Acknowledgements

I started working on this project after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EH1QzzXKM0) by YouTuber [JoeCoup](https://www.youtube.com/@JoeCoup1) where he decided to build an AI for the Game Pigeon game Filler.
I've previously designed Game AI's for games like Connect 4, and was inspired to take a crack at this particular game. His version's source code is available [here](https://github.com/swoyer2/Filler-AI). There is one other notable Filler solver
made by GitHub user ItsAsShrimpleAsThat that can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ItsAsShrimpleAsThat/FillerSolver). At the time, I have no plans to use any parts of their code. I intead to write my project around efficient storage structures and searching,
but I would be remiss to not mention the other people who had taken a crack at this problem.
